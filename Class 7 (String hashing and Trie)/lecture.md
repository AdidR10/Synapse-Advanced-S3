# Trie

- Why is it necessary?
- How does it work?
- Example applications
  - Check if pattern is a prefix of some string in a dictionary.
  - Maximum XOR of two numbers in an array.
  - Maximum XOR of a subarray in an array.
  - Number or XORs smaller than k of subarrays in an array.
- Implementation
- Trie concept applications
